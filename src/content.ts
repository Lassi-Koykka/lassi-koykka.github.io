        `I'm a dedicated and self-motivated software developer currently residing near Tampere. 
            I'm comfortable working with both back- as well as front-end technologies and my main tools of trade are

            <strong style="color: #512bd4\">.NET</strong> and <strong style="color: #FFDB4A">Python</strong>, 
            but I like to switch things up when I can and I'm not locked into any specific framework or language.`,
        `I'm a quick learner and I wish to understand how things actually operate under the hood. 
            I thoroughly enjoy the process of creative problem-solving and challenging myself by setting goals and restrictions. 
            On my spare time, I like to take part in coding challenges and work on all kinds of personal projects, from APIs to websites, games and desktop applications. 
            I have also recently grown an interest in <strong style=\"color: crimson\">cyber security</strong> and <strong style=\"color: #3E3\">ethical hacking</strong>,
            which I have been self-studying on my spare-time by completing CTF-challenges and by using platforms such as OverTheWire, TryHackMe and HackTheBox. 
            One of my favourite pastimes is playing around with new technologies and seeing what I can come up with. 
            I have built all kinds of fun little projects over the past few years and you can find all of them on my <a href=\"https://github.com/lassi-koykka\" style=\"color: lightblue; text-decoration: underline\">GitHub account</a>. :)`,
