        "I'm a dedicated and self-motivated software developer working in the greater Kuopio region. Originally I am from Tampere.",

        "I'm comfortable working with both back- as well as front-end technologies and my main tools of trade are <strong style=\"color: #007acc\">TypeScript</strong>, <strong style=\"color: #61DAFB\">React</strong>, <strong style=\"color: #FF3E00\">Svelte</strong>, <strong style=\"color: #418C3C\">Node.js</strong>, <strong style=\"color: #512bd4\">.NET</strong> and <strong style=\"color: #FFDB4A\">Python</strong>, but I like to switch things up when I can and I'm not locked into any specific framework or language.",

        "I'm a quick learner and I wish to understand how things actually operate under the hood. I thoroughly enjoy the process of creative problem-solving and challenging myself by setting goals and restrictions. On my spare time, I often like to work on all kinds of personal projects, from APIs to websites, games and desktop applications. One of my favourite pastimes is playing around with new technologies and seeing what I can come up with. I have built all kinds of fun little projects over the past few years and you can find all of them on my GitHub account. :)",
